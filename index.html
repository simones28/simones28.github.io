				<h2>Design for America</h2>
				<p>Design for America is a national interdisplinary organization that focuses on human-centered design. I served as Studio Lead President from August 2015 until January 2017 when I transitioned to Studio Advisor and trained my replacements. While President, I oversaw 15 projects, including a project sponsored by Chrsler and several which partnered with the Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology at Virginia Tech. I also grew the Virginia Tech branch in membership and professionalism.</p>

				<h2>Simple Computer</h2>
				<p>One project I especially enjoyed working on was the creation of a simple computer in one of my classes. We used Verilog to code a function unit and write hexcodes and opcodes for instructions and turn those into machine code. We continued to use this simple computer and the memory set up to write assembly code that carried out an algorithm to take a set of numbers and return the maximum, minimum, and average values. I enjoyed using a computer at such a basic level and starting from 1s and 0s to end with a working algorithm.</p>
